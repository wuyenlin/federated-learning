## Introduction
In 2017, H. Brendan McMahan, et al. published Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data. The paper describes the principle of Federated Learning and demonstrates a practical method of deep networks based on interative model averaging. 


This project is done by group 18 -- Stefan Hofman, Mirza Mrahorovi&cacute;, and Yen-Lin Wu, as a part of TU Delft's CS4240 Deep Learning course. We reproduced the paper results, as well as randomized the data distribution before weight updates and added noise to weights before communication with clients. 



## Federated Learning

With increasing use of mobile devices, the data stored on them can be used to improve, for example, language models, voice recognition, and text entry. Federated Learning allows users to collectively reap the benefits of shared models trained from such data without the need to centrally store it. However, such data are privacy sensitive in nature.

In this project, we investigate this learning technique proposed by Google. It is termed *Federated Learning*, since the learning task is solved by a loose federation of participating devices (*clients*) coordinated by a central *server* -- [H.Brendan McMahan et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05629). 
How the algorithm works is as follows: a central server shares its model weights with clients. Each client computes its own update on local training data and uploads it to the server that maintains the global model. The local training data set is never uploaded; instead, only the update is communicated for the global model. More formally, every client (k) trains on local data with SGD with a batch size B to obtain a gradient estimate g<sub>k</sub>, with learning rate &eta;.

After E epochs, the updated weights w<sup>k</sup> are sent to the server. The server then combines the weights of the clients to obtain a new model w<sub>t+1</sub>. This is done by assigning a higher weight to clients with a larger fraction of data n<sub>k</sub> / K.

This model is then re-distributed back to the clients for further training. The above explanation is visualized in the figure below.

Several questions arise here:
1. What happens to the convergence rate if the data is distributed in an uneven manner among users?
2. Would a simple weighted averaging of the models lead to faster convergence if the data is distributed in an uneven manner?
3. How much noise can the weight updates tolerate and what are the implications for data privacy?

In order to answer these questions, we adjusted the algorithm called *FederatedAveraging* that is introduced in the original paper. A series of 3 experiments are carried out to demonstrate its robustness to unbalanced and IID data distributions, as well as the ability to reduce the rounds of communication needed to train a deep network on decentralized data by orders of magnitude.

Full blog post on this reproducibility project is on [Medium](https://medium.com/federated-learning/reproducing-communication-efficient-learning-of-deep-networks-from-decentralized-data-6393ca963f7b). We start by replicating the results of the paper given the existing code from  [shaoxiongji](https://github.com/shaoxiongji/federated-learning). These results are presented in *Replication*. Next, we will present and discuss the results of the 3 questions presented above in Section *Uneven Distribution*, *Weighted Uneven Distribution* and *Noise robustness*. 


### Update July, 2020

The same reproduction is run on Intel i7-8565U, RAM 16GB, and Nvidia RTX 2060 (with 6GB GDDR6) in July 2020 and yielded the following results. For the paper reproduction, some cases reached an accuracy of 0.99 in the IID case, whereas none reached such accuracy in the non-IID case.
When B=10, it takes longer to reproduce the results but outputs better accuracy than B= &infin;.
